# React + TypeScript + Vite

This project provides a minimal setup to get started with React, TypeScript, and Vite. It includes configurations for HMR (Hot Module Replacement) and ESLint rules.

## Prerequisites

To work on this project, ensure you have the following installed:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) version 16 or higher
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) or [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/)

## Recommended VS Code Extensions

For a better development experience, install the following extensions in Visual Studio Code:

- [ESLint](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dbaeumer.vscode-eslint)
- [Prettier - Code formatter](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=esbenp.prettier-vscode)
- [Tailwind CSS IntelliSense](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=bradlc.vscode-tailwindcss) (if using Tailwind CSS)
- [Material-UI Snippets](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=vscodeshift.material-ui-snippets) (if using MUI)
- [Ant Design Snippets](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=chenshenhai.vscode-ant-design-snippets) (if using Ant Design)
- [WakaTime](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=WakaTime.vscode-wakatime) (for tracking coding activity)

### Setting Up WakaTime

1. Install the [WakaTime extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=WakaTime.vscode-wakatime) in Visual Studio Code.
2. Create an account on [WakaTime](https://wakatime.com/) if you donâ€™t already have one.
3. After installing the extension, open Visual Studio Code, and you will be prompted to enter your WakaTime API key.
4. Retrieve your API key from your [WakaTime account settings](https://wakatime.com/settings/api-key).
5. Paste the API key into the prompt in Visual Studio Code.
6. WakaTime will now start tracking your coding activity automatically.

## Project Standards

### React + TypeScript Best Practices

1. **Component Structure**:

   - Use functional components with hooks.
   - Organize components in separate folders with `index.tsx` and `styles.module.css` (if needed).
   - Place reusable components in `src/components` and page-specific components in `src/pages`.

2. **TypeScript Usage**:

   - Use `React.FC` for functional components.
   - Define props using TypeScript interfaces or types.
   - Avoid using `any` type; prefer specific types or generics.

3. **Styling**:

   - Use CSS Modules or libraries like Tailwind CSS, Ant Design, or Material-UI.
   - Avoid mixing multiple UI libraries in the same project.

4. **State Management**:

   - Use React's Context API or libraries like Redux Toolkit for global state management.
   - Use `useState` and `useReducer` for local state.

5. **Code Quality**:
   - Follow ESLint and Prettier rules for consistent formatting.
   - Write clean, readable, and maintainable code with meaningful variable and function names.

### UI Libraries

You can use one of the following UI libraries:

- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)
- [Ant Design (AntD)](https://ant.design/)
- [Material-UI (MUI)](https://mui.com/)

**Note**: Do not combine multiple UI libraries in the same project.

## Git Workflow

1. **Create a New Branch**:

   - For each feature or bug fix, create a new branch:
     ```bash
     git checkout -b feature/branch-name
     ```

2. **Commit Changes**:

   - Commit your changes with meaningful messages:
     ```bash
     git add .
     git commit -m "Description of changes"
     ```

3. **Publish Your Branch**:

   - Push your branch to the repository:
     ```bash
     git push origin feature/branch-name
     ```

4. **Create a Pull Request**:
   - After pushing, create a Pull Request (PR) in the repository and provide a detailed description.
   - Wait for review and approval before merging.
